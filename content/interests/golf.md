## Why start playing golf?
Golf is a sport for people who enjoy making minor tweaks to their game every other week, whether an improvement or not is another thing. Golf is a very social sport as you can spend up to four hours with a group per game, so plenty of time to catch up on things. It can be enjoyed for a lifetime as the impact on the body is relatively low although it is still possible to injure your back, shoulders or neck. If you like sweating the small things then golf might be the sport for you. Beware though it can be one of the most frustrating things you take up.

## How much does it cost
Golf comes with quite an investment if you want to get a quality set of clubs. To get a quality set of essential clubs you would be looking at around **$500-700**. To keep costs down try and look for second hand clubs. Golf clubs are quite durable so they are often in good shape. It's also important to note that this list does not include a full 12-club set as a beginner with an undeveloped swing wouldn't see any difference between 5-iron and a 6-iron for example.

In the long run golf balls will end up being your biggest expense. An decent set of balls will cost you between $30-$30. For the beginner looking to improve a quality ball can make the game more forgiving.

When you decide to start playing, consider any course fees or club memberships that you will need to pay. The prices will vary depending on the club so make sure to call around the local clubs to check prices. Practicing at driving ranges will also incur a cost so you can expect to pay $10-20 each time you go.

## Things to know before starting

- Golf is a sport packed full of traditions and etiquettte. Most clubs around the world would expect you to wear pants, shorts or skirts rather than jeans. Same for footwear, sandalds, joggers or tennis shoes are not considered appropriate for the golf course. This of course will depend on your club but it's better to just dress accordingly. Other common rules of etiquette are: no talking through someones back spin, being on time, don't hit the ball into a group ahead of you and conversely try not walk in front of someone's shot.

- All irons come in two designs, a Blade Iron and a Cavity Back Iron. The Blade Iron is designed for skilled players. It has a thin face with a smaller sweet spot meaning more room for error but at the same time providing more feel and better control. The Cavity Back Iron has a cavity at the back of the head, this adds extra weight to the edges of the face which makes it more forgiving. If you are just starting out then a Cavity Back Iron is recommended.

- The most common material used for the shafts is steel. Steel is stronger than graphite which means they will hold their shape better and provide more consistent and accurate swings. Graphite shafts are much lighter than steel shafts so they can potentially unlock greater distance in your shots by increasing your swing speed. For beginners, stick to steel, it's cheaper and more reliable.

## Essential Golf equipment

### Golf bag
Golf bags play an important part in your game for many reasons. If you're not travelling by buggy then you'll most likely have your bag sat on your shoulder for long periods at a time, and often while walking. So it's important this bag is comfortable rested on your shoulder and also appropriate for your height.

Bags are available in three styles, the first is what is known as a Staff Bag. The Staff Bag is a large bag that you would only use if someone was carrying it around for you, hence the name. It is not the bag you want to pick up when you're just getting started.

Then there are cart bags or stand bags. A cart bag offers plenty of storage and has a flat base designed to be placed in the back of a cart. The zips are often placed to be accessible from the back of a cart where a player would approach from. Where as a stand bag uses a stand to allow the bag to stand by itself just behind the player.

### 3-Wood
The reason this guide starts with a 3-wood and excludes a driver is because most instructors would teach you to start with a 3-wood when swinging off the tee. The shaft on the driver and the lower loft makes it much harder to get the hang off. A 3-wood may not go as far as a driver ultimately would but when you're just getting started you want to focus on precision not power.

3-Woods or Fairway Woods are typically used on the fairway but it is perfectly fine to use one off the tee. For many golfers a 3-wood is more reliable than a driver off the tee and can replace it completely.

When choosing a 3-wood you want to consider how fast your swing is. The general rule of thumb is, the faster your swing speed, the less loft you need to get the ball airborne.  If  your swing is faster than 100mph then consider a loft between 13-15 degrees. Any swings slower than that and you want to you will want to get closer to 15-17 degrees of loft.

### 5-iron
Now we're getting into the "mid-irons". The 5-iron typically has a loft of about 28 degrees and the average male can expect to hit the ball close to 150 yards. Generally you would use a 5-iron in the fairway, rough or hilly areas where you want to keep the ball at a lower trajectory. A 5-iron is a difficult club to master as it the flatter face does not give the ball much height.

### 7-Iron

### 9-Iron
The 9-iron, along with the 8-iron is known as a "short iron", it has a loft of 41-48 degrees, making it ideal for short chip shots. It is the iron with the greatest loft before you start getting into wedges. The lofty face means you will get decent height out of a shot that and an average player should reach about 120 yards. The 9-iron is a very versatile club that can save you from all kinds of prickly situations. From a short distance the 9-iron is the club of choice to end up on the greeen.
