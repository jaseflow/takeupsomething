## Why start playing golf?
Golf is a sport for people who enjoy making minor tweaks to their game every other week, whether an improvement or not is another thing. Golf is a very social sport as you can spend up to four hours with a group per game, so plenty of time to catch up on things. It can be enjoyed for a lifetime as the impact on the body is relatively low although it is still possible to injure your back, shoulders or neck. If you like sweating the small things then golf might be the sport for you. Beware though it can be one of the most frustrating things you take up.

## How much does it cost
Golf comes with quite an investment if you want to get a quality set of clubs. To get a quality set of essential clubs you would be looking at around **$500-700**. To keep costs down try and look for second hand clubs. Golf clubs are quite durable so they are often in good shape. It's also important to note that this list does not include a full 12-club set as a beginner with an undeveloped swing wouldn't see any difference between 5-iron and a 6-iron for example.

In the long run golf balls will end up being your biggest expense. An decent set of balls will cost you between $30-$30. For the beginner looking to improve a quality ball can make the game more forgiving.

When you decide to start playing, consider any course fees or club memberships that you will need to pay. The prices will vary depending on the club so make sure to call around the local clubs to check prices. Practicing at driving ranges will also incur a cost so you can expect to pay $10-20 each time you go.

## Things to know before starting

- Golf is a sport packed full of traditions and etiquettte. Most clubs around the world would expect you to wear pants, shorts or skirts rather than jeans. Same for footwear, sandalds, joggers or tennis shoes are not considered appropriate for the golf course. This of course will depend on your club but it's better to just dress accordingly. Other common rules of etiquette are: no talking through someones back spin, being on time, don't hit the ball into a group ahead of you and conversely try not walk in front of someone's shot.

- All irons come in two designs, a Blade Iron and a Cavity Back Iron. The Blade Iron is designed for skilled players. It has a thin face with a smaller sweet spot meaning more room for error but at the same time providing more feel and better control. The Cavity Back Iron has a cavity at the back of the head, this adds extra weight to the edges of the face which makes it more forgiving. If you are just starting out then a Cavity Back Iron is recommended.

- The most common material used for the shafts is steel. Steel is stronger than graphite which means they will hold their shape better and provide more consistent and accurate swings. Graphite shafts are much lighter than steel shafts so they can potentially unlock greater distance in your shots by increasing your swing speed. For beginners, stick to steel, it's cheaper and more reliable.

## Essential Golf equipment
If you want to know what golf clubs and equipment you should buy as a beginner then check out this list below.

### Golf bag
Golf bags play an important part in your game for many reasons. If you're not travelling by buggy then you'll most likely have your bag sat on your shoulder for long periods at a time, and often while walking. So it's important this bag is comfortable rested on your shoulder and also appropriate for your height.

Bags are available in three styles, the first is what is known as a Staff Bag. The Staff Bag is a large bag that you would only use if someone was carrying it around for you, hence the name. It is not the bag you want to pick up when you're just getting started.

Then there are cart bags or stand bags. A cart bag offers plenty of storage and has a flat base designed to be placed in the back of a cart. The zips are often placed to be accessible from the back of a cart where a player would approach from. Where as a stand bag uses a stand to allow the bag to stand by itself just behind the player.

### 3-Wood
The reason this guide starts with a 3-wood and excludes a driver is because most instructors would teach you to start with a 3-wood when swinging off the tee. The shaft on the driver and the lower loft makes it much harder to get the hang off. A 3-wood may not go as far as a driver ultimately would but when you're just getting started you want to focus on precision not power.

3-Woods or Fairway Woods are typically used on the fairway but it is perfectly fine to use one off the tee. For many golfers a 3-wood is more reliable than a driver off the tee and can replace it completely.

When choosing a 3-wood you want to consider how fast your swing is. The general rule of thumb is, the faster your swing speed, the less loft you need to get the ball airborne.  If  your swing is faster than 100mph then consider a loft between 13-15 degrees. Any swings slower than that and you want to you will want to get closer to 15-17 degrees of loft.

### Set of irons
Purchasing a set of irons generally ends up more economical than purchasing the clubs individually. Even though you should only start off by using the 5-iron, 7-iron and 9-iron, it's still worth while having them in your bag for the day you really get a feel for those three irons.

You can use the 5-iron for fairway shots and even when teeing off a par 3. The 7-iron and 9-iron can be for various approach shots. If you find it hard to get airborne, then consider getting a hybrid set. Hybrid irons are a mixture between woods and irons, sporting a noticabley smaller club head, reduced shaft and more height given to the ball.

### Sand Wedge
Wedges come with the largest loft of all the clubs. The sand wedge has the second most loft just before the Lob Wedge.

When you're starting out you will most likely be spending a lot of time in the bunker and bunker play is part of the game you can't run away from. So you want to be using the right tool, aka the Sand Wedge to get out of these sand traps.

The 9-iron is close enough in it's lofted angle to the Pitching Wedge that it can be used in it's place most of the time.

### Putter
The short game as it's known, is the most crucial element to having a good round of golf. Being able to capitalize on a good long game and come in under par is what will win you games.

Putting is just as much a mental game as it is anything else. So first of all having a putter that you love the look at, that fills you with confidence when you step on the green. Go for that one. After taking that into consideration you should find a putter that gives you a little room for error. You're looking for a putter that is stable and easy to align, generally you will find this in mallet style putters. They provide a more true shot where they have been optimized center of gravity. This is in contrast to a blade style putter where it is more sensitive to mistakes made during the put.

### Golf Balls
You're going to need balls and lots of them. As mentioned above, golf balls will end being your biggest cost for the entire time you play the sport.

It's a balancing act between investing in good enough balls that aren't detrimental to your shots but at the same time not wasting all your money on balls you're just going to lose. Make sure to spend plenty of time at the driving range using balls that belong to someone else so you can confidently purchase balls knowing you will hold on to them.

You will want to be picking up 2 piece balls to start off with. A 2 piece ball is more durable, travels further and will cost you much less than 3 piece balls. This is ideal for beginners as you will not be able to make the most of the spin and control that a 3 piece ball will offer.


### Tees
Tees are a no brainer here, you're going to use more tees than balls, thankfully they cost less. Really no need to get anything fancy here just as long as it keeps your ball of the ground.
