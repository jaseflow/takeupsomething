## Why start Cooking?
There are many reasons someone might want to start cooking. Maybe you want to impress a certain individual, maybe you need to learn since you're out on your own now or perhaps you just find it extremely satisfying? Cooking or food in general brings joy to everybody, so why not learn how to provide that joy in the best way possible.

## How much does it cost
If you're setting up your kitchen from scratch you can expect to pay between **$400** **and** **$600**. It's important to pay for the quality when it comes to knives, pots and pans. A high quality knife will be upwards of $150, although the Vetroinox brand provides good quality for low price. Pots and pans you should be paying about $100 for each.

## Essential Cooking items

### A Chef's knife

When you're just starting out there is no need to go out and get a knife for every day of the week. Pick up one quality Chef's knife and you're good to go. You will want the knife to be sharp AND durable. It's also important to make sure the knife feels good to hold, you're going to be spending a lot of time with it.

### Skillet / Frying Pan
Stainless Steel is the name of the game here. You could get cast iron or non-stick but to start off with the Stainless Steel provides variety, durability and is low maintenance.

### Heavy-bottomed Pot
Heavy-bottomed pots are thicker at the base meaning that they absorb and distribute the heat in a more even fashion compared to their thinner counterparts. This makes for more controlled and consistent cooking.

### Cutting board

When it comes to boards, you can't go past a thick, hard, wooden board. Glass boards will wreck your knife and your fingers will slip all over it. You may want to get a cheap plastic one to prepare meat on as it's easier to clean.

### Large Spoon
Any spoon will do here but I recommend a silicone spoon for the fact that it is much easier to clean, won't harbour nasty growths from over-use and lack of cleaning. It also won't scratch your pots and pans while still being strong enough to scrape things off the bottom.

### Peeler
Y-Peelers are known to give you more control by freeing up the supporting hand when peeling. They also allow you to move quicker when peeling simple things like carrots or similar shaped vegetables. Walk into a professional kitchen and you'll see all chefs with a Y-Peeler.

### Fine-Mesh Sieve
{{< attribution-image imageUrl="/posts/cooking/mesh-sieve.jpg" caption="A fine-mesh sieve sprinkling chocolate powder" author="Lindsay Cotter" authorUrl="https://unsplash.com/@cottercrunch" >}}

This handy little net does all the things. It can sieve fine ingredients like flour, be used as a colander for your beans, be used to wash rice or beans, it can also be used to fish things out of frying oil, even for juicing! For your sieve you want it to be made of sturdy stainless steel with a long handle. It's worth paying for quality here.

### Measuring spoons
If you're just starting out, don't try and eyeball a teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper. Find a good set of measuring spoons that a strong enough and long enough to fit into jars of all different shapes and sizes.

### Dry/Liquid Measuring cups
Similar to the dry spoons, you don't want to ruin your dishes by making guesses when you're just starting out. No need to break the bank on cups here, Pyrex is an affordable, sturdy and they can go in the microwave.
