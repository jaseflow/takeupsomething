## A Chef's knife
When you're just starting out there is no need to go out and get a knife for every day of the week. Pick up one quality Chef's knife and you're good to go. You will want the knife to be sharp AND durable. It's also important to make sure the knife feels good to hold, you're going to be spending a lot of time with it.

## Skillet / Frying Pan
Stainless Steel is the name of the game here. You could get cast iron or non-stick but to start off the Stainless Steel provides variety, durability and is low maintenance.

## Heavy-bottomed Pot
Heavy-bottomed pots are thicker at the base meaning that they absorb and distribute the heat in a more even fashion compared to a thinner version. This makes for more reliable and consistent cooking.

## Cutting board
When it comes to boards, you can't go past a thick, hard, wooden board. Anything else and it's going to wreck your knive and your fingers will slip all over it. You may want to get a cheap plastic one to prepare meat on as it's easier to clean.

## Large Spoon
Any spoon will do here but I recommend a silcone spoon for the fact that it is much easier to clean, won't harbour nasty growths from over-use and lack of cleaning. It won't scratch your pots and pans but is still strong enough to scrape things off.

## Measuring spoons
If you're just starting out, don't try and eyeball a teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper. Find a good set of measuring spoons that a strong enough and long enough to fit into jars of all different shapes and sizes.

## Dry/Liquid Measuring cups
Similar to the dry spoons, you don't want to ruin your dishes by making guesses when you're just starting out. No need to break the bank on cups here, Pyrex is an affordable, sturdy and they can go in the microwave.

## Fine-Mesh Sieve
This handy little net does all the things. It can sieve fine ingredients like flour, be used as a colander for your beans, be used to wash rice or beans, it can also be used to fish things out of frying oil, even for juicing! For your sieve you want it to be made of sturdy stainless steel with a long handle. It's worth paying for quality here.

## Peeler
Y-Peelers are known to give you more control by freeing up the supporting hand when peeling. They also allow you to move quicker when peeling simple things like carrots or similar shaped vegetables. Walk into a professional kitchen and you'll see all chefs with a Y-Peeler.
