## Tent
When you think camping, you think tents. That's because you wouldn't go camping
without a tent unless you're hardcore and don't mind sleeping rough.

The thing to pay attention to when buying a tent is how many people it sleeps.
If a tent says it sleeps four people then that is how many people *can* fit in
the tent not necessarily how many people *should* fit. If you want to sleep well
and have room for your belongings then look to get a tent that can accomodate
more people than you expect to be sleeping it.

Other important features to pay attention to are the material of the tent, you
want to make sure it is appropriate for the conditions you will be camping in.
You also want your tent to be easy to assemble. If you have your eyes on a
particular tent, make sure to Youtube how to pitch it and see what kind of
effort is involved.

## Sleeping Bag / Sleeping Pad
Camping is no fun if you're not getting a good nights rest. Therefore it's
important to invest in a good sleeping bag as well as a sleeping pad! A
sleeping pad will make a world of difference in comfort when lying on the hard
ground. Not only that it provides insulaton by trapping heat inside.
