## The must-have items

### Tent
When you think camping, you think tents. That's because you wouldn't go camping
without a tent unless you're hardcore and don't mind sleeping rough.

The thing to pay attention to when buying a tent is how many people it sleeps.
If a tent says it sleeps four people then that is how many people *can* fit in
the tent not necessarily how many people *should* fit. If you want to sleep well
and have room for your belongings then look to get a tent that can accomodate
more people than you expect to be sleeping it.

Other important features to pay attention to are the material of the tent, you
want to make sure it is appropriate for the conditions you will be camping in.
You also want your tent to be easy to assemble. If you have your eyes on a
particular tent, make sure to Youtube how to pitch it and see what kind of
effort is involved.

### Sleeping Bag / Pad

Camping is no fun if you're not getting a good night's rest. Therefore it's
important to invest in a good sleeping bag as well as a sleeping pad! By getting a good sleep you recover better for the next day, especially if you're hiking or doing any physical activities. Sleep plays an important role in the bodies ability in regulate your temperature, make sure you're appetite is good and keeping you're immune system strong.

Most sleeping bags adhere to a European Standard which allow manufacturers to consistantly and easily communicate their temperature ratings. The three temperatures categories are: **T Comfort, T Limit and T Extreme**. You will want to be purchasing bags in the T Comfort range. They are designed for an adult woman to a have a comfortable night's sleep, wearing one layer of clothing in a relaxed position.

In terms of shape there are three options, each option is suited for a particular climate:

- **Mummy Sleeping Bags** These are shaped like a coffin, wide at the shoulders and narrowing to the feet. This means you won't have as much room for movement but there is less space that needs to be filled with heat. These bags typically don't open up like a blanket.

- **Semi-Rectangular Sleeping Bags** These are the balanced bags that offer more space for the legs but are still tight enough to provide effective heat retention. They can also be opened up like a blanket for warmer climates.

- **Rectangular Sleeping Bags** These bags are just as wide at the feet as they are at the shoulders. They offer the most space and are designed for warmer climates where you may want to open the blanket up and even share with someone else.

Finally, there are two kinds of filling worth looking at:

- **Down fill** A down sleeping bag offers fantastic warmth for its weight. The lightweight material compresses down making for convenient transporation. They are also tough, if taken care of many bags will last ten years.

- **Synthetic** A Synthetic Sleeping Bag is appropriate for wet weather conditions as it is completely water proof. The only downsie is they are often heavier than their down fill counterparts so make sure to consider those extra grams.


### Camp Chair
A camp chair allows you to quickly move around the fire or pull up a seat where ever you choose to read a book. They should be light weight but sturdy enough to you be setting up on all kinds of surfaces and holding your weight. It's up to you what kind of features you need in the chair, some come zipped pockets, bottle openers, even cooling departments.

### Lighting
One of the things people love about camping is that once the sun is down, it's literally lights out. This sounds fun but can make getting around the camp at night unnecessarily difficult. By simply hanging up some lights at key points of the camp, for example on the way or at the toilet or even wearing a headlamp can make life a lot easier.


### Coffee
Coffee is not something to comes to mind straight away when you're packing your bags but there really isn't anything quite like a hot cup of coffee while you're out in the wilderness. Not only does it give you that little piece of comfort and an energy kick but it also keeps your bowel movements regulated (while we're on the topic.. pack toiletpaper). which is critical for when you're spending your day out and about, away from camp.

### Cookware
For cooking, a fry pan and a dutch oven should have you covered when it comes to most foods. A fry pan will take care of things such as cooking meats or eggs and the dutch oven can be used to boil vegetables or slow cook stews. You can also use your dutch oven to bake pbread or pie.

### Stove
If you are bringing food that needs to be cooked or your somewater without access to fresh water or if your campsite has a ban on fires then you're going to need to bring a stove.

Cooking on a stove is a safer, more convenient and consistant way to cook your food. A stove can be easily ignited with a match or lighter, even in windy conditions. Your food is cooked evenly and using one feels just like cooking at home in your own kitchen. The ability to change the intensity of the heat gives you control that wouldn't have with a fire.

Boiling water on a stove will take a long time, therefore it's worth bringing extra fuel if you think you will have to be doing this.

### Insect repellent
There are plenty of things you can do outside of clothing/repellents that can reduce the amount of interaction you have with insects. Such as making sure to avoid stagnant water, wetlands or any area with little air movement. If you do want to camp in an area like this then try spend little time outdoors and when you are always wear a tropic strength repellent and even get some repellent clothing. The smoke from a campfire will also act as repellent to mosquitos.

### First aid kit
You never know when you're going to need one of those so it's best to be prepared. A well stocked kit should definetely have different kinds of bandages, gauzes and wipes, pain and anti-inflammatory medicine, hydrocortisone cream, scissors, tweezers and antihistamine for allergic reactions.

Depending in your situation it can also be useful to have a kit containing an epi-pen in case of serious incidents or an emergency blanket if the conditions call for it.

### Water storage
Fresh water is not always readily available at certain camp sites so you will want to make sure you're bringing plenty of water for the length of your stay. Whether you're bringing water to be your primary source of drinking water or just for reserve, it's worthwhile having appropriate storage for the camp site as well as for when you're on the go. Even if you know that there is water available at your camp site you should still bring your own water.

For storing water around the camp site you want something that doesn't take up too much room and is super easy to function. Some storage tanks also come with wheels that make for easy transportation.

When it comes to waterbottles I would recommend using a bottle that can contain both hot and cold beverages. You also want your bottle to be well insulated so you can keep those teas hot or the water cool. Try to keep the bottle as light as possible without sacrificing strength.
