description: "Archery, like any other sport, can involve a large range of equipment and accessories. However, to get started all you really need are the basics: a bow, a string, some arrows, a bracer, finger tab, a quiver, a bow stand, a bow stringer and a target to shoot at."

## Bows
This may seem obvious, but it’s also the most important, and many times it’s not the easiest decision to make. There are countless bow options at a number of different price-points.

## Arrows
Another no-brainer, but finding the right arrow for your bow is important. Try to buy you bow and arrow together to make sure you find the perfect match. If you’re not sure, have an associate help you find the perfect arrows for your bow.

## Release
Also an aide for consistency, picking up a release, mechanical or otherwise, can greatly help you with your aracy. Do a little research first. Try a couple different types of releases. Then come in-store when you have a better idea of what you’re looking for.
## Arrow rest
This is  a device used to hold the arrow against the handle until it’s released.
## Sight
Mounted on the riser of your bow, a sight helps you aim your arrow.
## Targets
Now that you’ve got the basics out of the way, it’s time to get in some practice. Targets can be as simple or intricate as you prefer. Just keep in mind you’ll need some sort of a backstop (or block) to stop the arrow.
