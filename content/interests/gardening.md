## Why start gardening?
Gardening is a hobby that can be taken up anybody at any age. Most gardeners are gardeners for life once they get the "greenthumb". You will feel real satisfaction when you start watching your plants respond to the care you give to them as they grow day by day. Gardening will become part of your life as there is always something new to do in the garden everyday.

One of the main reasons the majority of people start a garden is to grow their own food. Until you've tried vegetables picked that day from your garden, you won't believe the difference in flavour and freshness compared to vegetables purchased at the store. If growing your own food doesn't interest you then growing a beautiful bed of flowers will bring vibrance and enchantment to your home.

## How much will it cost?
You can get up and running in the garden without forking (no pun intended) out too much cash. Assembling a set of tools to effectively start gardening will cost you around $200-300. Most of the items you won't be spending more than $50.

Other costs involved will be seeds or plants that have already started growing, soil, compost and chemicals to treat bugs. All these items can be purchased once you've planned out how, where and what you're going to grow.

## Essential gardening tools

### Gardening Gloves

Gardening gloves are *the* must-have item when you're out and about in your gardens. Some people will tell you to "get your hands dirty" and "feel the soil under your fingertips" but it's just not practical. Nobody wants to be cleaning dirt out from underneath your nails every time you're in the garden. Depending on where you are you in the world there is also the possibility of picking up all kinds of nasty bacteria from garden soil.

Gloves will prevent you from getting blisters and calluses as well as protecting any existing cuts you may have. If you're dealing with plants like Roses or Bougainvillea then a good set of gloves will stop you getting pricked by their thorns. Sporotrichosis, also known as "rose gardener's disease", is a nasty infection caused by the fungus in Rose thorns.

Different materials provide different levels of comfort and protection. If you are just moving soil around and don't see any risk of getting it then cotton gloves will do just fine. If you happen to be dealing with prickly plants then consider getting a leather pair. Finally, if you're handling chemicals like herbicides and pesticides then look at getting some rubber coated gloves.

### Gardening Fork
A garden fork, also known as a digging fork, looks just like a giant fork with its four prongs and long handle.

Garden forks are primarily used to open the soil. This helps to aerate the soil and assist with water peneration and drainage. Forks are the best tool for this job because they won't harm the worms or soil like the sharper and wider blade of a spade. They can also be used to move compost or mulch by simply stabbing the fork in and picking up big stacks at a time.

Similar to the spade you won't to find a fork that is suitable for your height. If you choose a fork with a longer handle it will be easier to use in a smaller garden but your back will get a proper work out. A longer handle will take less of a toll on the body but may be hard to manouver in tight spaces.

Forged steel forks are made from one piece of metal that is been forged in a furnace. This means that they are near unbreakable compared to a fork that is assembled from multiple pieces.

### Hand Trowel
{{< attribution-image imageUrl="/posts/gardening/trowel.jpg" caption="A used hand trowel laying on the lawn" author="Allan Lau" authorUrl="https://pixabay.com/users/allanlau2000-3215323/" >}}

Not to be confused with a hand towel. A trowel is a small spade that can be held in one hand that is used for digging small holes, applying fertilisers or smoothing out your soil.

There are different kinds of trowels that excel at particular jobs in the garden. Trowels with narrow blades do a great job of getting weeds out of those hard to reach spots. A trowel with serated edges can be used to slice roots, while one with a curved blade is handy for transporting soil or seeds around your garden.

The Japanese style Hand Trowel, known as a Hori Hori Garden Knife is one of the most versatile tools you can own and a great piece to have when you're starting out. This garden knife has a narrow head which makes it possible to reach tough spots, serated edges to cut through most plant materials or even open up bags of compost. Some even come with measurements engraved on the face of the blade so you can use it as a ruler. The blade is also slighty curved so it can be used to transport a small amount of soil or to place your seedlings.

### Spade
A spade is similar in shape to a shovel although there are notable differences. A spade has a flat blade that is longer and designed to cut through objects like a roots and compact soil. Spades are perfect for moving or splitting up your flowers as well as working in tight garden beds. The flat blade also makes them ideal for edging your garden bed or lawn.

You will want to pick up a spade with a large lip at the top of the blade so you can easily stand on it to apply more pressure. Remember to wear proper footware in the garden, no flip-flops!

If you are tall with longer arms you may prefer a spade with a long handle although remember if you're working in close quarters it's better to have the control and freedom provided by a shorter handle. It's worth going down to your local gardening shop and having a feel around.

### Pruning Shears / Secateurs
{{< attribution-image imageUrl="/posts/gardening/secateurs.jpg" caption="Bypass pruners cutting through a Rose" author="Jacqueline Macou" authorUrl="https://pixabay.com/users/jackmac34-483877/" >}}

Pruning shears, also known as pruners or secateurs are a small hand held scissor-like tool that can be used to trim your plants or herbs as well as cut through thicker branches.

There are two kinds of pruners, **Anvil** or **Bypass Pruners**. Each has it's way of slicing through your plants. An Anvil Pruner uses the top blade to slice through and down onto the bottom anvil, similar to how a knife would cut through meat and onto a chopping board. Whereas a Bypass Pruner uses both top and bottom blades that slide past each other, similar to how a typical pair of scissors works.

If you're working on living stems then it is recommended to use a Bypass Pruner as the Anvil Pruner tends to crush the plant causing damage. If you want to get rid of larger dead branches up to ½ inch thick then go for an Anvil Pruner.

Pruners come in a variety of materials and coating:

- **Stainless steel** Stainless steel pruners will not rust if you don't clean or remove moisture off them after gardening. They are softer than other available materials so they can become dull or even break if you attempt to cut through branches that are too thick.

- **Carbon steel** Carbon steel is reinforced with carbon to make them tougher and more durable. Carbon blades are prone to rust if not carefully cleaned and dried after use. They will provide more grit when trying to get through those thicker branches.

- **Titanium-coated steel** You can tell a titanium-coated blade by it's golden appearance. The titanium coating provides the reinforcement you get from carbon as well as the anti-rust feature you get with a stainless steel blade. Expect to pay a little more for the titanium.

### Watering Can
A watering can gives you total control over how much water your plants are getting. They are great for giving a drink to plants in hard to reach spots like hanging baskets. The force that the water comes out also means that your plants will be less damaged than if they're hit by the pressure of a hose.

Generally water cans come in either metal or plastic and it's really up to you which one you choose. A metal can (if galvanized) will last a little longer than a plastic can but will cost a little bit more. Plastic cans can contaminate the water so if you're using one on food you plan on eating then that's something to consider.o

One last thing to thing about is size, you don't want a can so small you have to fill it up after every pot plant and you also don't want that's so large you need a wheel barrow to carry it. Try and find one that's just right for your garden.

### Wheelbarrow
{{< attribution-image imageUrl="/posts/gardening/wheelbarrow.jpg" caption="A single and a double wheel wheelbarrow" author="Ēriks Irmejs" authorUrl="https://unsplash.com/@erxxx" >}}

A wheelbarrow is a tool that is important for any sized garden. Once you start using one you will wonder how you ever operated with out one.

There are a bunch of things you want to think about when purchasing your wheelbarrow:

1. **Does it look cool?** Very important.
2. **What material is it?** Steel is sturdier than plastic and can bear more weight, although they are generally heavier and harder to maneuver.
3. **How much capacity do you need?** The most common size is around 100L. This will be perfect for transporting most items around your garden.
4. **How many wheels?** One wheel wheeelbarrows are easier to dump their contents as you can tip forward then jig left and right but they are prone to tipping if you're not careful. 

One last tip is that just because a wheelbarrow says it can hold 400 pounds, doesn't mean you need to fill it with 400 pounds of stuff! Remember you still need to lift it and you don't want to injure yourself (or your wheelbarrow).

### Rake
What to look for in a rake? Well you want a rake that can do a bunch of things, not just rake leafs, you will also want to use it to seperate small stones from your soil or to strip dead grass from lawn.

The ideal rake will have a decent head size, anything between 20-24" wide will quickly scoop up your leafs. You will want sturdy tines (the spikey bits on the head) that have a slight curve at the end so they can really grab on to things. Aluminium alloy handles are lightweight and solid enough that they wont bend. You also won't get splinters from aluminium, whic is a real bonus!

### Hose

Water brings life to your plants and nothing distributes water more efficiently than a hose. Correctly irrigating your garden can save you time and money by making sure that you plants are getting just the right amount of water.

If you have an edible garden that is is laid out in an organized fashion then a Soaker Hose may be the best choice for you. A Soaker Hose is a hose that is laid on the ground around your garden that gently drips water into the soil. If you have your hose setup using a timer then it the garden pretty much waters itself. You can set and forget and then use all your free time on other tasks around the garden.

If a Soaker Hose isn't practical for your garden then a regular hose will still do just fine. Get a rubber hose as they can bend easier without breaking. Remember not to leave your hose kinked or in the direct sunlight for long times as this will cause them to weaken. You can purchase rectable hoses that wind up into a coil until the next time you use it.
